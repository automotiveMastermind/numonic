# NAME

numonic-git - a collection of extensions for the git cli that make it easier to work with forks and pull requests

# SYNOPSIS

numonic-git

# DESCRIPTION

Numonic includes a large collection of extensions to the git cli that make operating with forks and pull requests even
easier. These extensions are available via the git cli itself and can be aliased for even shorter names, if you so
choose. They are also tied into the git help system. For example, `man git-fork-clone` or `git fork-clone --help` will
both pull up the manual for the `fork-clone` extension.

# AVAILABLE COMMANDS

checkout-branch - a command used to create and switch to a new local branch
