# NAME

edit-bashrc - opens an editor to the user-specific bash startup script

# SYNOPSIS

**edit-bashrc** [**-d** | **--debug**] [**-h** | **--help**]

# DESCRIPTION

This command will open the editor defined by the **EDITOR** environment variable. If the variable is not set then the
default editor will be **vi**. Note that numonic will detect whether or not Visual Studio Code is available on the
current PATH and will set this to the default editor if not otherwise set in the user environment (**userenv**).

The user-specific bash startup script is located at:

\$HOME/.local/share/bashrc

If the file does not exist, it will be created with the correct shebang for bash.

For simple environment variables, we highly recommend using the **userenv** commands, which will make environment
variables available across different shells (both bash and zsh) and supports directory-specific variables as well.

# OPTIONS

## FLAGS

### -d, --debug

print the commands as they are executed (set -x)

### -h, --help

print this help information

# EXAMPLES
