# NAME

numonic-bash - an explanation of the well-known configuration and shell-specific commands for using numonic with bash

# SYNOPSIS

numonic-bash

# DESCRIPTION

Numonic strives to fully support both bash and zsh. As such there are very few commands that are available in only one
shell, which are mostly related to the specific implementation of the startup/shutdown files for the shell in question.

# CONFIGURATION

Numonic will always take ownership of and overwrite the default user startup/shutdown files. This is intended to ensure
successful update paths and compatibility across the board. There is, however, full support for user-specific overrides,
which are always loaded *after* the default files.

For bash, the following files are owned by numonic and cannot be modified by the user as these files will be
overwritten on every update:

\$HOME/.bash_profile
\$HOME/.bashrc
\$HOME/.bash_completion

To override any of the default configuration included by these files, please use the following location:

\$HOME/.local/share/bashrc

The **edit-bashrc** command will automatically create this file if does not already exist and open the file in the
default editor.
