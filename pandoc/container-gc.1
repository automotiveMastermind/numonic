# NAME

container-gc - garbage collects all stopped containers and dangling volumes and images for both podman and docker

# SYNOPSIS

**container-gc** [**-d** | **--debug**] [**-h** | **--help**] [**-q** | **--quiet**]

# DESCRIPTION

This command will prune all containers and dangling volumes and images for both podman and docker. At least one of these
must be available on the **PATH** or the command will fail. If both are on the **PATH**, then both will be pruned.

The command essentially performs the following where \<command\> is either `podman` or `docker`:

\<command\> container prune --force
\<command\> volume prune --force
\<command\> image prune --force

# OPTIONS

## FLAGS

### -d, --debug

print the commands as they are executed (set -x)

### -h, --help

print this help information

### -q, --quiet

suppress any output to stdout (any errors will still be printed)

# EXAMPLES

## container-gc

garbage collect both docker and podman, if available

## container-gc --debug

garbage collect both docker and podman, if available, while printing the commands as they are executed
