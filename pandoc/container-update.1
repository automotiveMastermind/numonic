# NAME

container-update - pulls the latest image layer or manifest for each tag that is locally cached within both podman and
docker

# SYNOPSIS

**container-update** [**-d** | **--debug**] [**-h** | **--help**] [**-q** | **--quiet**]

# DESCRIPTION

This command pulls the latest image layer or manifest for each tag that is locally cached within both podman and docker.
At least one of these must be available on the **PATH** or the command will fail. If both are on the **PATH**, then both
will be updated. This is primarily useful for images are up to date locally when referencing vanity tags.

The command essentially performs the following:

\<command\> images --filter dangling=false --format \\
 '{{.Repository}}:{{Tag}} | xargs -L1 \<command\> pull

# OPTIONS

## FLAGS

### -h, --help

### -q, --quiet

suppress any output to stdout (any errors will still be printed)
